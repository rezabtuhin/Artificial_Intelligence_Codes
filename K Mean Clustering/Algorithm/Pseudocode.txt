# Load data.csv into 2D numpy array "Data" 
# Load centers.csv into 2D numpy array "Centers"
# Initialize 2 2D lists named "Clusters" and "Temp_Clusters", each containing 6 1D lists for the 6 centers 
# "iteration" = 0 
# While True:
# 	for each sample "S" in "Data":
#		for each center "C" in "Centers":
#			Determine distance between "S" and "C". Keep min distance "C" index stored always
#		You now have the closest center "C" (Suppose, "C" has index "i" in "Centers")
#		Append "S" in "i"th list of "temp_Clusters" (Just append the index of "S" found in "Data")
# 	Now your "Temp_Clusters" 2D list contains 6 1D lists, each containing samples belonging to corresponding centers
#   for each 1D list "L" in "Temp_Clusters":
#		Determine avg
# 	These 6 averages are the new centers. Assign these to "Centers". 
# 	"Iteration"++
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	if "Iteration" > 1:
#		for each sample S in Data:
#			See in which list it was in "Clusters" and which list it is now in "Temp_Clusters"
#			If the lists are different, then there has been a shift
#		See how many such shifts has taken place and store the number in "Shift"
#		if "Shift" < 10:
#			Assign "Temp_Clusters" to "Clusters" and break the loop (convergence)
#	Assign "Temp_Clusters" to "Clusters"

"Clusters" will contain your desired clusters and "Centers" will contain your desired centers at the end of loop
